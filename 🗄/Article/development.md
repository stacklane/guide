# What Development Process Works Best for Stacklane?

Stacklane encourages use of the BizDevOps approach to application development.

DevOps is the overlap of what were traditionally silos:  operations, development, and QA.  Instead of treating these as separate, DevOps brings them together to improve communication and collaboration, and align strategy and objectives for faster and more efficient results.

Stacklane is your outsourced architecture, operations, and IT team.

Compared to DevOps alone, BizDevOps removes the silos between DevOps teams and business teams.  BizDevOps integrates business leaders into the DevOps lifecycle, creating a streamlined workflow from business strategy to deployment and maintenance.  Developers are given a seat at the decision-making table, and have a say in the strategic planning of a product.

BizDevOps is _not_ just for big teams – it works for small teams too, and even solo developers.  Because BizDevOps tightly integrates what used to be very separate roles, these roles may be represented as a single person who is starting out by wearing multiple hats.

Ultimately BizDevOps allows companies to execute on a vision faster and more efficiently, while minimizing rework based on unforeseen requirements.

# How Does Stacklane Reduce Technical Debt?

Good software and companies last for years, through thousands of iterations.  From the very first stack choice, be it a language, framework, library, or cloud infrastructure, the risk of technical debt begins.  What happens if that once shiny new framework is no longer supported?  Amongst your own business goals, how do you ensure that you allow time for security patches, or adjusting your application to account for a deprecated third party feature?  What happens when a key developer moves on?

Stacklane reduces the risk of technical debt by providing a complete, full-service, turnkey architecture and infrastructure stack.  These layers are tightly integrated for simplicity, scale, and security.  They provide your new web app a head start in focusing on the “what” and “why” instead of “how”.  This unified stack will keep developers of all skill levels pointing in the same direction towards business goals, without having to risk major decisions that could add seen or unforeseen technical debt.

Just as importantly, Stacklane guarantees that the code you write will always run on our platform unchanged.  We believe in the platform we’ve built, and because of its abstraction layer it will not require you to make code changes as we introduce new features over time.  Similarly we guarantee not to remove, deprecate, or alter any existing Stacklane APIs that your app uses.

# How Does Stacklane Help With New Developers?

Stacklane was built with the skill levels and aptitudes of all developers in mind.  New developers can expect a first steep then quickly flattening learning curve.  We minimize the steepness by _not_ introducing new languages, user interfaces, or other tools into the development process.

Junior developers are provided architecture-in-a-box, keeping the quality of software consistent and scalable.  Senior developers will appreciate making quicker decisions, not having to reinvent the wheel, or reach for a library.  Business owners can reduce technical debt, and ensure a common architecture, practices, and on-boarding experience as developers change over time.

# How Does Multi-User Development & Version Control Work?

Stacklane supports the use of GIT centralized version control using GitHub or BitBucket.  Both public and private repositories are supported.

As with any GIT repository, multiple developers can manage revisions and conflicts as well as create branch lines, which can be merged back to a mainline branch as required.

By using GitHub or BitBucket you can more easily use the tools you already know and love, including their collaboration opportunities.  Stacklane wants to support your existing development tools and processes, not take them over.

The beauty of GIT and version control is that it can be as simple or complex as your team and business goals require.  During early stages you may choose to iterate on a single GIT branch named “master”, "live", or "production", by regularly merging changes from another branch named "development".  Later, as your software stabilizes, you may choose a more formal strategy such as tagging a release "v1.4.1", and then using this tag for production deployment.

Stacklane’s production deployment process works directly with whatever version control strategy you’re choosing or evolving to.
