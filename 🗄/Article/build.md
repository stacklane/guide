# What Types of Projects Are a Good Fit for Stacklane?

Stacklane excels at web apps which unite _users_, _content_, and _commerce_.  Together these three broad categories span many industries and business cases, including marketing websites, support and knowledge bases, membership or subscription driven content, blogs and podcasts, storefronts and shopping carts, social networks, information rich sites, project or task management, and much more.

Startups looking for architectural, framework, infrastructure, or cloud guidance, look no further – in many cases Stacklane can replace the need for a chief architect or technical officer.  Build your entire web app on Stacklane, and enjoy fast iterations, without sacrificing long term scale and security.

For existing businesses, use Stacklane to supplement existing web apps and technologies.  The platform plays well in the larger web ecosystem, allowing you to host on your own sub-domain, and connect to existing first or third party systems which expose REST APIs.


# How Does Stacklane Support Customer Engagement Apps?

Customer engagement applications are a synthesis of _users_ and _content_. They enable customers, clients, or partners to interact and transact with the business, connect with each other, and ultimately increase satisfaction, retention, and revenue.

With these web apps, the business has a fairly well-defined idea of the app, but the development team must adapt to issues revealed during the application development lifecycle.  In terms of usability, customer-facing apps often encounter high expectations from a wide range of user skillsets, and must therefore be able to quickly adapt as changing needs are identified.


# How Can Stacklane Augment an Existing Business or Web App?

For an existing web app or business, Stacklane can work to supplement your main web app, without introducing new operational complexity.  What may normally require many separate vendors can be placed under the Stacklane umbrella instead – support and knowledge bases, status pages, intranets, and e-commerce initiatives.

For any project Stacklane may be installed on a sub-domain you already own, blending into your existing URL structures.  Using Stacklane Connectors, you can communicate with any existing REST-based API technology, to pull or push content for your existing business’s web application.


# What Should I Not Build in Stacklane?

While there are endless possibilities for what apps can be built with the platform, we do have some advice on what you should not build in Stacklane.

If your application requirements may be purchased or outsourced, and the solution provides most of the requirements you need, as well as any branding requirements, then buying that off-the-shelf product is recommended.  Buying such a solution is often more cost-effective, adheres to best practices, and is faster to implement.

Generally if application needs stretch too far beyond _users_, _content_, and _commerce_, then Stacklane is unlikely to be a good fit.  For example, if you are building an application which anticipates building complex algorithms, then Stacklane would not be a good for building these systems.  However Stacklane may be a good fit to build any web-facing and user related needs which then connect to those externally hosted algorithms.

Finally, Stacklane is not a good fit for building games or replacing enterprise bus systems.  For example with a game, Stacklane would not be a good fit for building the game itself.  However Stacklane may be a good fit for providing any underlying web services to supplement your game – for example user profiles if the game has any social component.
